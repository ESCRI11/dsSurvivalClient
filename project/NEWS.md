v1.0.0: A basic first release of survival models in DataSHIELD. This release has Cox proportional hazards models, summaries of models, diagnostics and the ability to meta-analyze hazard ratios. There is also capability to generate forest plots of meta-analyzed hazard ratios. This release supports study-level meta-analysis (SLMA).


A shiny graphical user interface for building survival models in DataSHIELD has also been created by Xavier Escriba Montagut and Juan Gonzalez. It uses dsSurvival and dsSurvivalClient.
